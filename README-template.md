## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (Variables)
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Mobile-first workflow
- Background Images and Patterns
- CSS Preprocessor (SCSS)
- Box Shadow and Border Radius
- Responsive Units
- Linking External Fonts

### What I learned

From this challenge, I've gained a deeper understanding of using semantic HTML5 to structure content effectively, which enhances accessibility and SEO. I've learned to utilize SCSS for more organized and maintainable styles through variables and nesting. Implementing Flexbox has taught me how to create responsive layouts that adapt well to different screen sizes. I also improved my skills in responsive design by applying media queries and utilizing CSS custom properties to maintain consistency in design. Overall, this project has strengthened my ability to create visually appealing and functional web components while following best practices in modern web development.

### Continued development

Building on this challenge, I can continue developing my skills in responsive design by exploring CSS Grid, which will allow me to create more complex layouts with ease. I can also enhance my understanding of accessibility practices to ensure my web components are usable for everyone, including those with disabilities. Additionally, I can experiment with advanced SCSS features, such as mixins and functions, to further streamline my styles and reduce redundancy. Furthermore, diving into JavaScript could add interactivity to my components, making them more engaging for users. Overall, this challenge has opened up several avenues for further growth in front-end development.
